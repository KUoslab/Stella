# Stella Integrated scheduler

Stella integrated scheduler is a scheduling architecture for providing required performance to virtual machines running concurrently on a virtualized server.
The integrated scheduler includes different types of resource scheduler in a physical server, CPU, block and Network I/O, to support diverse workload running on virtual machines with different characteristics (CPU-intensive or I/O-intensive).

## PREREQUISITE

Because GoS is designed for virtualized environment equipped with SSDs, it requires following environments.
 - KVM installed Linux
 - SSD equipped virtual machines
